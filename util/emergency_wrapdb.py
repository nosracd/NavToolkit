When Meson wrapdb is down, use the emergency fallback wrap downloader
provided by Meson - ghwt.py.
ghwt.py source: https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/blob/master/ghwt.py

You can check if wrapdb is down by trying to perform the following
command in the project root:  meson wrap list

If wrapdb is down and you are missing packages from wrapdb:
1. In the SUBPROJECTS dictionary below, add a new entry for each subproject
   that is needed
   - Only those subprojects whose .wrap file in the subprojects folder
     has an entry for "patchurl" that starts with
     "https://wrapdb.mesonbuild.com" needs to be added
   - The dictionary key should be the basename of the .wrap file
2. In the SUBPROJECTS dictionary below, remove entries for any subprojects
   that are no longer needed
3. Update the value for each dictionary entry to the appropriate branch.
   - Typically the branch names correspond to the dependency version
     number.  When this script calls ghwt.py, ghwt.py should print out
     all possible branches for each subproject. Select one of those.
4. Execute this script from the project root: python util/emergency_wrapdb.py
5. Run meson without attempting to download packages:
    meson setup build -Dwrap_mode=nodownload
