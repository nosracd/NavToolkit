 * A class to validate matrices.  Instantiate and then call add_matrix() with a matrix to validate,
 * followed by the validation functions to perform on that matrix.  A context can hold multiple
 * matrices, to validate across all matrices in the context if needed.  After the specific checks to
 * the first matrix are added, call the next matrix with add_matrix() and follow that with the
 * validation functions for the second matrix.
 *
 * Some validation functions apply only to one matrix.  The validations will be performed
 * immediately.
 *
 * Validation functions that apply across matrices will not be performed until validate() is called.
 *
 * To disable matrix validation, compile with `-DNO_MATRIX_VAL`.  This will increase performance.
