/**
 * Class used to read geoid undulation data from 'WW15MGH.GRD', a standard undulation file available
 * from https://earth-info.gs.mil/
 *
 * Geoid height is the actual height above mean sea level (often abbreviated MSL).
 *
 * Ellipsoid height is the height above an ellipsoid model of the Earth (often abbreviated HAE).
 *
 * Geoid undulation is the geoid height relative to the ellipsoid height (i.e. geoid height minus
 * ellipsoid height).
 *
 *
 * The file begins with a header line containing the range of latitudes and longitudes covered by
 * the file, as well as the steps between each. Steps in current file version are 0.25 degrees, and
 * are unlikely to change. The file is then separated into 'records'. Each record contains all
 * undulation values at a given latitude for the entire span of longitudes. The first record
 * contains the undulations at latitude 90 deg, the second 89.75 deg, and so on to -90 deg. Each
 * record contains 1441 undulation values for longitudes from 0 to 360 deg. Each 'record' is
 * comprised of 9 'blocks', each preceded by an empty line, and then a single value corresponding to
 * a longitude of 360 on another line, also preceded by an empty line. Each 'block' is comprised of
 * 20 lines with 8 undulation values per line. Block 0 covers longitude 0 to 39.75 deg, Block 1 40
 * to 79.75 deg, and so on until 359.75 deg longitude. Each line in a block contains 8 values, with
 * each value being allowed a 9 character spacing, except the first (which has 10). The 10 character
 * limit also applies to the single values corresponding to lon = 360.
