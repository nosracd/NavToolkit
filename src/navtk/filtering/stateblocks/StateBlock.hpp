/**
 * A description of a set of states estimates, associated covariances, and the states' dynamics.
 *
 * `StateBlock`s are used by a fusion engine, along with one or several `MeasurementProcessor`s and
 * a `FusionStrategy`. `StateBlock`s allow the fusion engine to predict how states will change over
 * time, via dynamics models. `MeasurementProcessor`s give the fusion engine the models needed to
 * relate measurements to the states. The `FusionStrategy` is responsible for providing the fusion
 * engine with the general algorithms used to combine the information from `StateBlock`s and
 * `MeasurementProcessor`s.
 *
 * A `StateBlock` provides the fusion engine with a dynamics model, the number of states
 * (`#num_states`), and a label (via `#get_label`). A dynamics model usually consists of the
 * non-linear discrete-time state-transition function, denoted as `g`, the Jacobian of `g`, denoted
 * as `Phi` (used in the linear equation), and the discrete-time process noise covariance matrix,
 * denoted as `Qd`. These three quantities are used by the fusion engine to propagate the states
 * and their covariances forward in time when `StandardFusionEngine::propagate` is called, using
 * the output of `#generate_dynamics`. See `ModelType` template documentation for additional
 * information about when the dynamics model contents may deviate from those described.
 *
 * @tparam ModelType The type of DynamicsModel returned by the `#generate_dynamics` function.
 * Currently two are available. The `StandardDynamicsModel` is meant for cases where Gaussian states
 * are simply propagated via the `StandardDynamicsModel.g` function with no additional perturbation;
 * the uncertainty increase due to propagation is handled via `StandardDynamicsModel.Qd`, a
 * discrete-time representation of average white Gaussian noise inputs in the state-space.
 * The `SampledDynamicsModel` on the other hand does not assume that the states can be modeled as
 * Gaussian; the `SampledDynamicsModel.g` function is free to treat each `navtk::Vector` input as a
 * sample from an arbitrary but known distribution and propagate it accordingly, possibly adding
 * random noise samples directly to the states.
