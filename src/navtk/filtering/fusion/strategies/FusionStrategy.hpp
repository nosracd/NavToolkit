/**
 * Interface for an internal representation of states used by a fusion engine that can be
 * represented as a state vector (#get_estimate) and a covariance matrix (#get_covariance).
 *
 * An implementation of FusionStrategy is required by a fusion engine. The fusion engine uses a
 * fusion strategy to combine the information from state blocks and measurement processors to
 * propagate and update the estimate and covariance of the states in a fusion engine. The fusion
 * strategy provides the algorithm backing the `StandardFusionEngine::propagate` and
 * `StandardFusionEngine::update` methods, which predict future values of states and adjust states
 * based on new measurements, respectively.
 *
 * If a fusion strategy natively deals in the estimate and covariance (as in
 * navtk::filtering::EkfStrategy, for example), the navtk::filtering::LinearizedStrategyBase
 * struct implements this interface with the estimate and covariance backed by simple fields.
 *
 * Subclasses should verify their behavior conforms to expectations by adding themselves to the
 * typed test case in FusionStrategyTests.cpp.
