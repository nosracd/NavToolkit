/**
 * An implementation of the StandardFusionEngineBase interface.
 *
 * The `StandardFusionEngine` requires a #strategy that specifies the type of fusion strategy (EKF,
 * UKF, RBPF, etc). The #strategy provides the algorithm backing the
 * `StandardFusionEngine::propagate` and `StandardFusionEngine::update` methods, which predict
 * future values of states and adjust states based on new measurements, respectively.
 *
 * The filter requires a dynamics model in order to propagate. A `StateBlock` block provides a
 * dynamics model for a group of states, such as position, velocity, and acceleration of a vehicle
 * being estimated by the `StandardFusionEngine`. The `StateBlock` also provides the number of
 * states (`StateBlock::num_states`), and a unique identifier (StateBlock::get_label()). At least
 * one `StateBlock` block is required by `StandardFusionEngine` in order to propagate, though
 * additional `StateBlock` blocks may be added to the fusion engine.
 *
 * The fusion strategy constructs a state estimate vector (xhat) and covariance matrix (P) large
 * enough to allocate `StateBlock::num_states` coefficients for each state block. These are grouped
 * according to their `StateBlock::get_label()`. An incoming measurement may relate to any number of
 * StateBlocks. The filter propagates the corresponding `xhat` states to a specified time using the
 * dynamics model. `StateBlock::generate_dynamics` provides the dynamics model,
 * `StandardDynamicsModel`. The complete list of `StateBlock` blocks in the `StandardFusionEngine`
 * can be accessed by using #get_state_block_names_list.
 *
 * The filter requires a measurement model in order to update. The `MeasurementProcessor` provides
 * the measurement model. The purpose of a measurement model is to map states to measurements, such
 * as mapping GPS pseudorange measurements to position, velocity, and acceleration state estimates.
 * When the raw measurements are received, the `MeasurementProcessor::generate_model` is used to
 * provide a `StandardMeasurementModel`. The `StandardMeasurementModel` provides all parameters
 * necessary for the #strategy update: the measurement vector (`z`), the corresponding measurement
 * covariance matrix (`R`), measurement prediction function that returns expected measurement vector
 * (`h`), and matrix providing approximate mapping of states to measurements (`H`).
