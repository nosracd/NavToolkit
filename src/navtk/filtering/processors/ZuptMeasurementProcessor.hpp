	/**
	 * Constructor for processor that updates only one state block.
	 *
	 * @param label Name of this processor.
	 * @param state_block_label A label referring to a Pinson-style StateBlock this processor
	 * updates. It is required that the block have an estimate vector of at least length 6 and
	 * elements[3..5] contain NED velocity error state in m/s.
	 * @param cov 3x3 Covariance matrix to be used for the zero velocity update.
	 * @param window (optional) Number of IMU measurements to collect and average together before
	 * updating movement status. A longer window can potentially reduce classification error by
	 * removing more noise, but will result in a longer lag in status (movement status is held
	 * constant over the collection period), with a value of 1 indicating real-time estimation. See
	 * inertial::MovementDetectorImu.
	 * @param calib_time (optional)  Number of seconds of guaranteed stationary data at the
	 * beginning of processing. This stationary data is used to form a rough estimate of sensor
	 * biases and noise levels that are used as the basis of IMU movement detection. See
	 * inertial::MovementDetectorImu.
	 * @param speed_cutoff (optional) Nominal speed threshold for platform to be considered moving
	 * using a position domian movement detector, in m/s. Speed in all axes must be below this value
	 * to be classified as stationary over the period between 2 position inputs. See
	 * inertial::MovementDetectorPos.
	 * @param zero_corr_distance (optional) Threshold distance used in position domain movement
	 * detector, between two sequential position measurements at which they are considered
	 * uncorrelated, in m. Correlation between the the two measurements is linearly scaled based on
	 * the norm distance between the two points; Minimum value is 1, and anything less will be
	 * silently replaced. See inertial::MovementDetectorPos.
	 * @param mov_detect_imu_weight (optional) Relative weight assigned to this plugin. Must be
	 * positive. See inertial::MovementDetector#get_status() for how weights affect results. See
	 * inertial::MovementDetector.
	 * @param mov_detect_imu_stale (optional) Amount of time (seconds) allowed to have elapsed
	 * between this plugin's inertial::MovementDetectorPlugin#get_time result and the latest
	 * inertial::MovementDetectorPlugin#get_time result from all plugins before treating the status
	 * from this plugin as temporarily invalid. See inertial::MovementDetector.
	 * @param mov_detect_pos_weight (optional) Relative weight assigned to this plugin. Must be
	 * positive. See inertial::MovementDetector#get_status() for how weights affect results. See
	 * inertial::MovementDetector.
	 * @param mov_detect_pos_stale (optional) Amount of time (seconds) allowed to have elapsed
	 * between this plugin's inertial::MovementDetectorPlugin#get_time result and the latest
	 * inertial::MovementDetectorPlugin#get_time result from all plugins before treating the status
	 * from this plugin as temporarily invalid. See inertial::MovementDetector.
	 * @param state_count (optional) number of state blocks associated with state_block_label. If 0,
	 * the measurement processor will size the H matrix based off `gen_x_and_p_func()`, otherwise
	 * this field will be used to size the H matrix, which reduces computational expense.
